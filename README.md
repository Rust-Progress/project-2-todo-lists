# Rust Project 2 - Programming a Todo List App

In this list, using the things I learnt before, I managed to make a simple todo list app in Rust. No fancy database stuff. The lists are stored within RAM.
Once the program stops, all your lists are lost. Feel free to make issues to comment on my code! Any feedback is appreciated!
